### How to use it?

- First, install the primary key - it can then be used to install our keyring and mirrorlist:
  - `# pacman-key --recv-key 3056513887B78AEB --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com`
  - `# pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB`
  - `# pacman -U 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst' 'https://cdn-mirror.chaotic.cx/chaotic-aur/chaotic-mirrorlist.pkg.tar.zst'`
- Append (adding to the **end** of the file) to `/etc/pacman.conf`:
  - `[chaotic-aur]`
  - `Include = /etc/pacman.d/chaotic-mirrorlist`
